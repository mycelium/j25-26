review
Best movie ever!
This film was terrible and boring.
It was okay, nothing special.
Absolutely fantastic, a masterpiece.
I fell asleep halfway through.
Not my cup of tea, but well made.
The acting was superb, but the plot was weak.
A complete disaster of a film.
Simply brilliant.
I would watch it again a thousand times.
Avoid at all costs.
Decent, but forgettable.
Thrilling from start to finish.
The special effects were amazing.
A very touching story.
Predictable and cliché.
Unexpectedly good!
Wasted potential.
Hilarious, I laughed so hard.
Truly inspiring documentary.
