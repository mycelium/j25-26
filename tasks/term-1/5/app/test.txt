Good effort, but the pacing was too slow to keep me engaged.
The soundtrack was phenomenal and fit perfectly with every scene.
A solid movie with a few flaws, but overall enjoyable.
Incredible visuals but lacking emotional depth.
Absolutely terrible — I left the theater halfway through.
Charming, heartfelt, and beautifully directed.
The actors tried their best, but the script was laughably bad.
Enjoyable, but definitely not as great as the reviews say.
A visual masterpiece that will be remembered for years.
Predictable story, but the humor made it watchable.
This was one of the most touching films I've seen recently.
Too long and boring, could have been half the length.
The lead actor delivered a career-best performance.
Nothing new or exciting, just another generic action film.
Completely forgettable — I don’t even remember the ending.
A delightful surprise! Way better than I expected.
Average movie with good moments but weak character development.
An inspiring and powerful story that brought me to tears.
Not terrible, but not good either — just meh.
