This movie was absolutely amazing. I really loved every minute of it and the ending was beautiful.
The film started well, but then it became boring. I almost fell asleep in the middle and the final scene was disappointing.
At first the movie felt slow, but later it became more interesting. Some scenes were great, some were just okay. Overall it was fine to watch once.
The acting was terrible and most jokes were not funny. However, the soundtrack was nice and a few dramatic moments worked well.
The story is simple and easy to follow. There is nothing very special, but nothing really bad either. It feels like an average movie for a quiet evening.
I expected more from this director. The plot was weak and characters were flat. I would not recommend this film to my friends.
The visuals were stunning and the special effects were impressive. The pacing was good and I never felt bored during the whole movie.
