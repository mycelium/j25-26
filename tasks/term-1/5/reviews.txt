This movie was absolutely amazing! Great acting and fantastic storyline.
Terrible film, complete waste of time and money.
It was okay, nothing special but not bad either.
The cinematography was beautiful but the plot was weak and confusing.
One of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life.
Brilliant performance by all actors, highly recommended!
Mediocre at best, expected much more from this director.
Outstanding movie with great special effects and engaging story.
Boring and predictable, I fell asleep halfway through.
A true masterpiece of modern cinema that everyone should see.
Test test.
