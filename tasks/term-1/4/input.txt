**Title: The Forchan Autist in Agartha (Director’s Cut)**

The screen flickered. One moment, Anon47 was deep in a 3 AM Twitter thread—arguing about flat Earth, ancient aliens, and why the CIA was definitely hiding something in Antarctica. The next, his fingers froze mid-typing. The glow of his monitor warped, stretched, and then pulled him in.

He gasped, stumbling onto cold, black stone. The air smelled of ozone, burnt incense, and something older than time. Around him, towering pillars carved with non-Euclidean sigils pulsed with a faint, sickly blue light. Shadows slithered along the walls, moving in ways that made his stomach clench.

Ah. Another surface-dweller.

Anon spun. A tall, emaciated figure in tattered robes stood before him, its face a shifting mass of eyes and something like a smile. Behind it, a group of square-jawed, blue-eyed warriors with blood-red hair stood in perfect formation, their armor etched with runes that burned like ice. Their gazes locked onto him, unblinking, judging.

You reek of the digital void, the robed figure hissed. How... amusing.

Anon’s hands trembled. "What the actual fuck—" He reached for his phone. No signal. No Twitter. No /x/. Just the weight of forgotten eons pressing down on his soul.

Then, from the darkness, the clank of boots. A squad of WWII-era German soldiers marched into the chamber, their uniforms pristine, their faces hollow. One of them turned to Anon, his eyes black voids, and whispered in perfect English:

We found the entrance in ‘45. We’ve been waiting for you.

Anon’s brain short-circuited. "Okay, okay, okay—" He swallowed hard. "So, uh... you guys are, like, the real Thule Society, right? The ones who—"

Silence.

Above them, the ceiling split open. A fleet of **flying saucers**, etched with **Nazi insignia and occult symbols**, descended into the chamber. Their metallic bodies hummed with energy, and from their undersides, **red laser beams** sliced through the air. The warriors with blood-red hair raised their hands, and suddenly, **their eyes glowed crimson**. Twin beams of light shot from their sockets, cutting through the stone like butter.

Anon ducked behind a pillar as a laser blast seared the ground where he’d been standing. "WHAT THE FUCK?!"

The robed figure sighed. You ask too many questions.

Anon spotted a **can of energy drink** lying on the ground—pristine, untouched, glowing faintly. He grabbed it, cracked it open, and chugged it in one go. His vision sharpened. His heart pounded. He felt **invincible**.

"Alright, you eldritch Nazi LARPers," he shouted, wiping his mouth. "If I’m gonna die, I’m taking at least one of you with me!"

He hurled the empty can at the nearest flying saucer. It **clanged** against the metal, and for a second, everything went silent.

Then, the saucer **exploded**.

The robed figure stared. The red-haired warriors hesitated. The German soldiers **panicked**.

Anon grinned. "Told you Monster gives you wings, motherf—"

The last thing he saw was a **laser beam** from a dozen pairs of glowing eyes, converging straight at him.

His final tweet—never sent—would’ve been:
"okay but what if the Nazis won but they’re all just weebs now and Agartha is their anime convention"
