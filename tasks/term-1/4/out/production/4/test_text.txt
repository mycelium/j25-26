Today people travel a lot around the world. They can go on trips by cars, buses, ships, by slow or fast trains or by planes. Travelling is the best way to know a lot of wonderful places and meet interesting people. I would like to see unusual places and famous cities, If I go to Australia, I will be able to see the koala, the emu and the red kangaroo. I also dream to go to the USA because I want to see the Statue of Liberty and the skyscrapers of New York. Tourists always want to see the White House in Washington, D.C. I think I will be able to understand American English. I have already known some American words: movie, candy, fall.
